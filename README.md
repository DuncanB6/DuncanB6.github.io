# Billboard Project

This project is a website for myself (Duncan Boyd) to showcase myself and some of my projects.

## Resources

- Some icons used in my first version of the website are pulled from [Font Awesome](fontawesome.com).

- [This website](https://undraw.co) is a great resource for some themed images.
