    "fullDescription": "I began 3D printing in 2021 when I got a Makerbot Replicator printer courtesy of UBC Aerodesign. I enjoyed learning design and overcoming the limitations of that printer as I made various useful and decorational projects. Since then, I've upgraded to a Prusa MK3S+, which has allowed me to improve the quality of my prints as well as expand my choice of materials. Through a variety of small projects, I've learned to design parts in Solidworks, Onshape, Fusion 360, and FreeCAD, as well as manufacture projects using PLA, ABS, ASA, and TPU.",
