    "fullDescription": "This is a bit recursive! Billboard is the name for this website, which I've designed as a personal profile for myself. Billboard is written using HTML, CSS, and JS from scratch (albeit with some tutorials) as a learning experiment. Some exciting features include a custom photo carousel and dynamic project and experience sections, powered by Javascript. Check out the GitHub below for some more information!",
