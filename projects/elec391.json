    "fullDescription": "This project was part of my ELEC 391 design course at UBC. With a team, we designed and tested a robotic claw to detect and move various objects. I focused on the mechanical design of the claw, which involved FEA simulation, Simulink simulation, CAD design, and manufacturing challenges. The claw uses a rack and pinion gear system with a parallel linkage.",
