    "fullDescription": "This project was part of my ELEC 442 robotics course at UBC. With a group, we used a Raspberry Pi, iRobot Create 2, STM32, and LiDAR sensor to map an unknown room and navigate between two points in the room. I focussed on the low level API used to control the Roomba's movements and sensor readouts, as well as the interface between the Raspbarry Pi and a local computer for remote control.",
